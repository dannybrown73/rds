## Pages

RDS apps and sites are a collection of related pages. A page refers to the full user interface (UI) of an application at a given time. Pages are scrollable and include content off screen, as long as it is accessible without reloading the page.

### Page templates 

Page templates control the pageâ€™s design and establish predefined sections to display content. You will define separate templates for the various aspects of your site. Typical templates found in RDS themes include:

- base
- home 
- single
- category

#### Page template sections 

Page templates in RDS, are made up of the following sections:

- Header
- Body
- Footer
- Off canvas

Page template sections are important as certain [layouts](#) and [blocks](#) can only be used in certain sections. For example, the [Banner block](#) can only be used within a page template header.

## Layouts

Layouts are used to arrange the content [blocks](#) within a page template section. Layouts control blocks in a responsive manner across all screen sizes. Layouts generally setup columns and act as containers for blocks. [Learn more about layouts](#).

## Themes

Themes package up and contain all of the assests and styles that make up an entire functional site, including: templates, layouts, blocks and components. [Learn more about RDS themes](#).

## In summary

RDS sites are made up of a collection of page templates that arrange layouts to control blocks. It becomes clearer as you work with the system and get use to the nomenclature.

Remember: 

- Layouts go inside specific template sections
- Template sections never nest within other template sections
- Blocks never nest within other blocks
