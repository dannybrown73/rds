Page templates exist within your sites theme or app and express how your site is displayed. Varying between projects, these are dynamic files written in languages like PHP or templating engines like Handlebars or Twig, that contain a mixture variables or expressions, which get replaced with values when the template is evaluated.

The page template controls the look and feel of the page by calling in all of the needed template partials, including RDS blocks and layouts. They establish the primary document sections, including:

- head
- page header
- body section
- page footer
- off canvas areas

How you work with and develop your templates will depend on the CMS or templating engine being used to build your site. As mentioned, the concept of templates in RDS is pretty much equivalent to WordPress templates or templating engines like Nunjucks, Handlebars or Twig. Usually, there is some sort of template inheritance and a single base template can contains most of the common elements.

We will be documenting templates further within specific app documentaion.
